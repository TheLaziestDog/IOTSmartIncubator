PMS or Plant Monitoring System, is a school engineering project that utilize Automation and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor and mantain incubators used for plant tissue culture. The system is focuses to automate and reduce the labor and time required to maintain and monitor a plant tissue culture incubator, making the plant tissue culture process more efficient and cost-effective.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

### MONITORING
- Monitor plant & incubator [conditions](plant/about.md) 
- Shows the sensors data on a LCD display
	
### CONTROL
- Controls incubator temperature and humidity.
- Regulates how much sunlight the plant will get.
- Protects the plant from potential threats such as insects, pests, and diseases.

### AUTOMATION
- Provide the plant with sufficient and appropriate nutrition at the right time based on the time and NPK sensor data.
- Water the plant automatically based on the time, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data that the sensor gather..

### IOT
- Sends data sensors to multiple IoT platforms such as a custom spreadsheet database and Blynk IoT.
- Regularly collect all of the (conditions) data automatically and systematically to provide the users with ready to use (matured) data for further analysis of the plant condition.
- Can integrate with any existing system management.


## ‚ô•Ô∏è How To Contribute
To contribute, you need to make a new branch and adding changes inside that branch, or you can just adding changes in the main branch, but you need to click on the "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request", so it can automatically create new branch for your changes, so your changes can be merged from pull request. 

It's that easy to contribute, if you want to discuss about anything outside the code itself, feel free to talk and dm me on discord!
